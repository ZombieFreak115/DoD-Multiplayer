DONE:

Implemented expliot proof grants from HMPS

no naval cap

Scandi can get EITHER elbian accepted n cored, or irish accepted n cored (baltic german is given to both)

DM rework, similar to femboy dod, you can pick either french or english until 1840, where if you havent picked anything by that point, you'll take the dual route and get all accepted by 1870. Less anglois pops too

Changed RGOs around a lil bit

utility and host decisions/events

Immigration and pop mechanics from alstadt

able to send goods with grants after 1850 (market regulations tech)

reduced factory build time

imported alot of decision changes from zoomer dod, which removes alot of reform and govt conditions for decisions

removed mob size from conscription reforms, instead it simply gives army bonuses at the cost of other maluses. can be changed once a year with a event

added new military and navy factories

fabric no longer requires dye to make, and dye is required for clothes directly instead. Basically it means clipper convoys dosent require dyes to build, but just more cotton
